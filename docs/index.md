AutoScAn (Automated Scaling Analysis) is a tool for finding the best architectural and hyperparameter choices of deep learning pipelines, and for analysing how those choices behave as you scale models, data, and compute.
Use it for hyperparameter optimization (HPO), neural architecture search (NAS), or any other design choice in your pipeline, from a single GPU to a multi-node cluster or even multiple clusters.

> AutoScAn is a fork of [NePS (Neural Pipeline Search)](https://github.com/automl/neps), licensed under Apache-2.0. See the [citations](citations.md) for the original work.

AutoScAn brings together [years of our algorithmic advances](citations.md) (e.g., in NeurIPS, ICML, or ICLR) with a runtime tailored to large scale models. AutoScAn is actively maintained and used to run on many different clusters, tuning even billion-parameter scale models with many concurrent trials.

To learn about AutoScAn, check out [the documentation](getting_started.md), [our examples](examples/index.md), or our [Colab tutorials](#tutorials).

## Why AutoScAn

### Tailored to large scales models

- **Tuning distributed models:** AutoScAn works with [DDP](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html) and [FSDP](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP1_tutorial.html), on a single node or across multiple nodes, out of the box ([examples](examples/efficiency/index.md)).
- **Zero-effort to run many concurrent models:** start more workers on the same machine or in a multi-node setup. As long as they share the results directory, they coordinate on their own, with no server to set up.
- **Live monitoring and interventions:** follow a run with `autoscan.status`, live plots, or [TensorBoard](reference/analyse.md#visualizing-results), and steer it without starting over: add workers, extend the budget, re-run failed trials, or import tuning results from anywhere (even cross-cluster).

### Efficient tuning algorithms

- **Low-fidelity evaluations:** principled use of cheap evaluations, such as fewer epochs or less data, to rule out bad configurations early.
- **Expert knowledge and prior studies:** use your intuition as priors, and results from earlier studies, when you have them.
- **Model-based search:** strategies such as Bayesian optimization choose promising configurations smartly instead of sampling blindly.

### Generally applicable

- **Any design space:** hyperparameters, architectures, resource allocation, or any component of the pipeline.
- **Any scaling dimension:** use epochs, dataset size, model size, or any other quantity as the fidelity.
- **Any and multiple objective:** optimize pre-training loss, downstream tasks, resource usage, or several of them at once.

## Installation

AutoScAn supports Python 3.11 to 3.14. Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install auto-scan
```

## Basic Usage

Using `autoscan` is based on the following pattern:

1. Define an `evaluate_pipeline` function that evaluates a configuration of your pipeline.
1. Define a `pipeline_space` of the parameters to optimize.
1. Call `autoscan.run(evaluate_pipeline, pipeline_space)`.

In code, the usage pattern can look like this:

```python
import autoscan
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


# 1. Define a function that accepts hyperparameters and computes the validation error
def evaluate_pipeline(lr: float, alpha: int, optimizer: str):
    # Create your model
    model = MyModel(lr=lr, alpha=alpha, optimizer=optimizer)

    # Train and evaluate the model with your training pipeline
    validation_error = train_and_eval(model)
    return validation_error


# 2. Define a search space of parameters; use the same parameter names as in evaluate_pipeline
class ExampleSpace(autoscan.PipelineSpace):
    lr = autoscan.Float(
        lower=1e-5,
        upper=1e-1,
        log=True,  # Log spaces
        log_base=10,  # Logarithm base, by default it's natural log
        prior=1e-3,  # Incorporate your knowledge to help optimization
    )
    alpha = autoscan.Integer(lower=1, upper=42)
    optimizer = autoscan.Categorical(choices=["sgd", "adam"])


# 3. Run the AutoScAn optimization
autoscan.run(
    evaluate_pipeline=evaluate_pipeline,
    pipeline_space=ExampleSpace(),
    root_directory="path/to/save/results",  # Replace with the actual path.
    total_evaluations_to_spend=100,
)
```
